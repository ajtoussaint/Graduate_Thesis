# Graduate_Thesis
A repository to compile all of the code and notes for my graduate school thesis project. The goal of this project is to create a novel model that is capable of performing cognitive diagnosis and outperforms exisitng models or provides some novel utility. This will be done by incorporating the latest cognitive modeling formulas with existing neural network implementations. The model will be evaluated by its ability to predict the correctness of a students response to a question having been trained on the response history of the student and a large set of other students and given that in both cases all questions are labeled with a set of knowledge concepts associated with the question.

## Models
Includes code for various cognitive diagnosis models that will be compared to the model I am creating. Each folder contains a different model and an individual README file describing the model and the source. Some models are copied directly from exisitng github repositories which are cited within the folder as well.

## Notes
Includes papers I will be citing, descriptions of models, descriptions of datasets, and miscellaneous notes I have taken while reading relevant papers. The notes folder is best read by using the [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) app which can be downloaded for free. If you are not using obsidian there are a few peculiarities in the markdonw that will be explained below.

[[<File Name>]] is a link to another markdown file within the "Notes" directory. The text inside the brackets will be the exact file name and possibly a file path if multiple files share the name.

![[<Image Name>]] is a link to insert some image. You can likely find the referenced image in an "Images" directory at the same level as the markdown file you are reading.

.obsidian is a directory that handles formatting and changes when viewing the "Notes" directory using the obsidian app. It can be ignored.

## Datasets
Each file is a note describing a different dataset relevant to the project. Datasets generally include response data from a group of students on a set of questions with labeled knowledge concepts. All datasets have been used in one of the source papers in an experimental capacity.

## Models
Each file contains a description of a cognitive diagnosis model. The description includes the models input, output, and mathematical process for computing the output as well as a link to the paper where the model was introduced and statistics regarding the model's performance

## Sources
Each file contains notes on a published paper relevant to this project. The title of the file is the name of the author(s) (maximum 3 and et al) and the year the paper was published. The file includes the title of the paper, a brief overview of how it is relevant to the project, a list of models introduced in the paper, a citation, a link to where the paper can be found online, and a desciption of how it relates to other papers.

## Terms
As I encounter technical terms that are frequently repeated throughout the literature I create notes describing these terms in the context of cognitive diagnosis models for clarity.
