# Area Under the (ROC) Curve

Take an integral to determine the area under a given test's [[ROC Curve]]. 

A value within 0.5 < AUC < 1 means the classifier has a chance to distinguish positive class values from negative ones.

A rough rule of thumb is that the accuracy of tests with AUCs between 0.50 and 0.70 is low; between 0.70 and 0.90, the accuracy is moderate; and it is high for AUCs over 0.90.
