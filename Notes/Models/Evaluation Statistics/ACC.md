# Accuracy
A model's accuracy is the raw ratio of responses that a model is able to correctly predict from some test or validation dataset. Typically, based on an input of student and exercise information a model generates a percentage likelihood that the student correctly answers the exercise. This value is compared to some cutoff point, for example 0.5 and if it is greater than the models response is "correct", if lower the response is "incorrect". This is compared to the true value to determine the accuracy.

Accuracy = (True positive + True Negative) / (Total Trials)
