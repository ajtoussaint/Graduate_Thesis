# Root Mean Squared Error
Root mean squared error measures the difference between actual values and predictions made by a model. A smaller RMSE score indicates better performance. 

RMSE is calculated as shown
```
SQRT(1/N * SUM((xi - x)^2))

N = number of samples
x = true value
xi = predicted value
```
