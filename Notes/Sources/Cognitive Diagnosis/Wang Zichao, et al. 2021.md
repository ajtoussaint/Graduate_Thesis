# Results and Insights from Diagnostic Questions: The NeurIPS 2020 Education Challenge
## Summary
The paper summarizes a the top performances from almost 4000 entires into a competition to create statistical and AI models to predict student performance. While 4 tasks were included in the competition the only relevant task was task 1 which involved predicting dichotomous correct or incorrect responses based on student history. The top paper for this task was [[Takehara, Shinahara 2020]]. 

The competition showed the importance of considering domain knowledge when implementing a solution as solutions based around practical education theory often outperformed brute force state of the art machine learning. However, to some extent these new methods have yet to be fully developed to their maximum potential.
