- A [[Gaussian Mixture]] is a [[Mixture Distribution]] [[Probability Distribution]] where all included distributions are gaussian.
	- A Gaussian mixture specifies a [[Prior Probability]] and a [[Posterior Probability]]
	- Gaussian mixtures are universal approximators which can approximate any smooth density with a specific amount of nonzero error with enough components.
