- is a 2D array represented in uppercase bold
- Matrix addition is simple just add the values in place, matrices must be same shape
-  Matrix multiplication is more complex, to achieve AB A must have a column for each row in b. If a is m x n and B is n x p then the result of multiplication will be a m x p matrix C where $C_{i,j} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} A_{i,k} B_{k,j}$  
	- Matrix multiplication is associative, distributive, but NOT commutative
-  An element wise product is also defined for a Matrix by using an approach similar to addition
