- A [[Probability Mass Function]] or PMF describes the [[Probability Distribution]] for discrete [[Random Variable|random variables]]. 
	- Represented with uppercase "P"
	- The domain of P is all states of x $\forall x \in x, 0 \le p(x) \le 1$ 
	- Typically normalized such that $\sum_{x \in x}P(x) = 1$ 
	- In a Uniform [[Probability Distribution]] each state is equally as likely
