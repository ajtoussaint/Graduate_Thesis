- [[Singular Value Decomposition]] is a form that can be applied more generally than [[Eigendecomposition]] 
	- every real [[Matrix]] has a [[Singular Value Decomposition]]: $A=UDV^T$  
	- A is an m x n matrix, U is m x m , and V is n x n, D is n x m
	- U and V are [[Orthogonal]] [[Matrix|matrices]]  and D is a [[Diagonal]] [[Matrix]] but not necessarily [[Square]]
	- D's diagonal includes the [[Singular Values]], 
	- U's Columns include the Left [[Singular Vectors]] and V's columns include the Right [[Singular Vectors]]
