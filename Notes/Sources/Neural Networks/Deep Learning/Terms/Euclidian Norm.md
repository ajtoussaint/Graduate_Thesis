- The [[Euclidian Norm]] is a [[Norm]] where $p=2$   which is often simply $\lVert x \rVert$ 
	- The derivatives of the [[Euclidian Norm]] depend on the entire vector
	- The Euclidian Norm increases slowly near the origin which is undesirable when it is important to distinguish very small values from zero, in this case use the L1 [[Norm]] which grows at a constant rate
