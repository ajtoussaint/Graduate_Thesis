The [[Multinoulli Distribution]] also called the categorical distribution, is used to model a single [[Random Variable]] which has "k" discrete states
	- $p \in [0,1]^{k-1}$ where p is a vector describing the [[Probability Distribution]]
	- Used to describe categories of objects
	- [[Variance]] and Mean are typically not of interest
- [[Bernoulli Distribution]] and [[Multinoulli Distribution]] are sufficient to describe any distribution within their specialized domains
