- [[Newton's Method]] is a form of[[Gradient Descent]] that uses information in the [[Hessian]] to guide the descent
	- $x^*=x^{(0)}-H(f)(x^{(0)})^{-1}\nabla_xf(x^{(0)})$ can be applied to jump directly to the minimum if f is quadratic
	- If f approximates a  quadratic this approach can be applied iteratively
	- This is faster than [[Gradient Descent]] but can get stuck on saddle points
