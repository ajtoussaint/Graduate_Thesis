Cited by [[De La Torre 2009]] and [[De La Torre, Douglas 2004]] as the basis for "multiple classification models" which [[DINA]] and [[HO-DINA]] fall under because the potential number of combinations of binary skills is finite.

It is also noted for the theory that a given response is in fact a series of latent responses and its description of disjunctive models where a subset of attributes can compensate completely.
