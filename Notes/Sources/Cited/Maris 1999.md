# Estimating multiple classification latent class models

This paper introduces the idea that a students completion of a problem is based on a combination of multiple latent skills. The model describes represents each skill as a binary value for mastery or non-mastery. Both conjunctive and disjunctive models are discussed suggesting that in some cases all skills are necessary and in others a subset of skills is sufficient. Bernoulli distributions are applied to the expected response due to the binary nature of the skills. 

Also a complete response is said to be made up of several latent responses. Each "component" of a latent response has its own probability density function and the product (or sum) of these components leads to the latent response either being 1 or 0. The product (or sum) of the latent responses must be 1 in order to get the question right.

It is noted that guess and slip parameters exist in the psychological reality but they were removed from the model to preserve interpretability. The model was tested in an experiment using Tatsuoka's 1985 fraction addition dataset.

Cited by [[De La Torre 2009]] and [[De La Torre, Douglas 2004]] as the basis for "multiple classification models" which [[DINA]] and [[HO-DINA]] fall under because the potential number of combinations of binary skills is finite.

It is also noted for the theory that a given response is in fact a series of latent responses and its description of disjunctive models where a subset of attributes can compensate completely.
