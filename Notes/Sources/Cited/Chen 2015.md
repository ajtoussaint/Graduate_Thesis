# Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence Classification
## Summary
The paper proposes a deep CNN using two serial convolutional layers to capture local semantic features of a semantic question for the purpose of finding an answer within an existing knowledge base. This approach is proven to be more effective than a parallel CNN. Both models use word2vec representations of words.
