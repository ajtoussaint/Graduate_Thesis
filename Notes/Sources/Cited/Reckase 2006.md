# Multidimensional Item Response Theory
## Summary
A textbook that provides an overview of IRT and MIRT as well as implementation details and how they can be applied for the purpose of categorical adaptive testing. Content of the text is summarized in each of the notes pertaining to the specific models linked below.

## MIRT
- Two types of models
	- Linear combination of theta coordinates (compensatory)
	- Cognitive task is separated into parts and a separate [[IRT]] model is applied to each part. The final probability of correctness is the product of the individual parts. As a result different traits are less capable of compensating for each other (partially compensatory)
- Majority of models are based on dichotomous questions
- any number of latent skills may be included in the model
