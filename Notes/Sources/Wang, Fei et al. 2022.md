# NeuralCD: a general framework for cognitive diagnosis
## Summary
A precursor to [[Wang, Zhifeng et al. 2023]] The authors produce a model that takes an input of a set of questions, responses, and knowledge concepts and produces as an output the cognitive diagnosis of the student responsible for the input. Question inputs are based on [[ASSIST09-10]] or MATH datasets which are available in the documentation. An extension of the proposed model is able to improve performance by using a separate convolutional neural network to label questions with concepts. While it is often shown to add a substantial number of incorrect labels as well as correct ones, the exaggerated labeling is still able to improve performance of the main model over human labeled questions.
